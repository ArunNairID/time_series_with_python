# Time Series with Python

### Kaizen Data Conference, San Francisco, September 16th, 2016

At Kickback we use Machine Learning to analyze video games data to provide our users with the best experience. Time series analysis is at the core of what we do, since a video game is essentially a sequence of actions in time. In this workshop you will learn to apply machine learning to time series and you will design your first algorithm to catch a cheater.
